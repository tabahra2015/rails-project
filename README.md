Hereâ€™s a more concise breakdown:

1. **Generate Models and Associations**:
   Use the following commands to create three models:

   ```ruby
   rails generate model Post title:string content:text
   rails generate model Event name:string description:text
   rails generate model Comment content:text commentable:references{polymorphic}
   ```

   - `Post` and `Event` represent different types of content.
   - `Comment` has a polymorphic association (`commentable`) so it can belong to either `Post` or `Event`.

2. **Run Migrations**:
   Apply the database changes:

   ```ruby
   rails db:migrate
   ```

3. **Create Views**:
   - For both `Post` and `Event`, create `new` and `show` views to allow users to add and view entries.
   - For `Comment`, create a `new` view so users can add comments to posts or events.

4. **Add CSS Styling**:
   Add basic CSS to style the forms and display pages for a cohesive look across `Post`, `Event`, and `Comment` views.
